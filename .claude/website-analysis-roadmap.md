## 2. Critical Issues & Blockers

### 2.1 üö® Deployment Blockers (CRITICAL)

#### **TypeScript Compilation Failures**
- **Impact**: Prevents production builds and deployments
- **Scope**: 20+ compilation errors across the codebase
- **Primary Issues**:
  - React Router type generation conflicts with `.jsx` files
  - Missing type definitions in counterpoint module
  - Generic type conversion errors
  - Backup directory type mismatches

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix TypeScript errors to enable deployments

#### **Zero Test Coverage**
- **Impact**: No automated validation of core functionality
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Music theory validation logic untested
- **Coverage**: 0% across 457-line `chordLogic.js` and critical game components
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Vitest configured but no test files exist

**Immediate Action Required**: Implement basic test coverage for core music theory functions

### 2.2 ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### **Code Duplication Crisis**
- **Scope**: Music theory utilities duplicated across 14+ level files
- **Impact**: Maintenance nightmare, inconsistent behavior risk
- **Examples**:
  - `noteNames`, `chordTypes` constants copied 14+ times
  - `getMidiNoteName()`, `isBlackKey()` functions duplicated
  - Chord validation logic repeated instead of imported

#### **Configuration Inconsistencies**
```javascript
// Found in multiple locations - violates single source of truth
export const REQUIRE_INVERSION_LABELING = false;
```
- **Risk**: Different behavior across levels
- **Solution**: Centralize configuration management

#### **Performance Bottlenecks**
- **Large Functions**: `validateAnswer()` (214 lines), `generateChord()` (140 lines)
- **UI Thread**: Complex chord generation could cause lag
- **Bundle Size**: No code splitting implemented
