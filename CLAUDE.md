# Project Memory - Chord Recognition Inversion Toggle

## Inversion Labeling Toggle System

### Overview
A toggleable boolean system has been implemented to disable inversion labeling requirements across all chord recognition levels while preserving the inversion functionality for future use.

### Configuration Locations
- **Basic Triads & Extended Chords**: `apps/web/src/app/chord-recognition/basic-triads/shared/chordLogic.js:6`
  ```js
  export const REQUIRE_INVERSION_LABELING = false;
  ```
- **Chord Progressions Level 2**: `apps/web/src/app/chord-recognition/chord-progressions/level2/page.jsx:11`
  ```js
  const REQUIRE_INVERSION_LABELING = false;
  ```

### How It Works
When `REQUIRE_INVERSION_LABELING = false`:
- **Basic triads/extended chords**: Validation accepts base chord names (e.g., "C", "Dm") instead of requiring inversion notation (e.g., "C/1", "Dm/2")
- **Chord progressions**: Generates progressions without inversions and accepts roman numerals without figured bass notation (e.g., "I V vi IV" instead of "I V6 vi IV64")

When `REQUIRE_INVERSION_LABELING = true`:
- **Basic triads/extended chords**: Validation requires inversion notation and accepts multiple formats:
  - Numbered inversions: "C/1", "C/2", "C/3"
  - Descriptive inversions: "C/first", "C first inversion", "C 1st inversion"
  - **Slash chord notation**: "C/E" (first inversion), "C/G" (second inversion), "Cmaj7/B" (third inversion)
- **Chord progressions**: Requires figured bass notation (e.g., "I V6 vi IV64")

### Affected Levels
1. **Basic Triads Level 2** (first inversions)
2. **Basic Triads Level 3** (all inversions) 
3. **Basic Triads Level 6** (7th chord inversions)
4. **Extended Chords Levels 1-2**
5. **Chord Progressions Level 2** (progressions with inversions)

### Code Changes Made
- Modified `validateAnswer()` function to strip inversion notation when flag is disabled
- Updated progression generation to use basic progressions without inversions
- Modified instruction text to reflect optional inversion labeling
- All inversion code preserved - no deletion, only conditional behavior

### How to Toggle
- **Current state** (disabled): Both flags set to `false`
- **To re-enable**: Change both flags to `true`
- **Result when enabled**: Full inversion requirements restored (C/1, Dm/2, I V6 vi IV64, etc.)

### Why This Was Implemented
User requested to disable inversion labeling requirements across all levels while preserving the code for potential future reversion. This allows students to focus on chord type identification without needing to specify inversion positions.

### Slash Chord Notation Feature
When inversion labeling is enabled, the system now accepts slash chord notation where the bass note is specified:
- **First inversion examples**: "C/E" (C major with E in bass), "Dm/F" (D minor with F in bass)
- **Second inversion examples**: "C/G" (C major with G in bass), "F/C" (F major with C in bass)
- **Third inversion examples**: "Cmaj7/B" (C major 7 with B in bass), "Dm7/C" (D minor 7 with C in bass)

The system automatically calculates the correct bass note for each inversion:
- **First inversion**: Third of the chord in bass
- **Second inversion**: Fifth of the chord in bass
- **Third inversion**: Seventh of the chord in bass (for 7th chords)

### Technical Implementation Details
- Uses conditional logic based on the boolean flag
- Validation functions check the flag and adjust expected answers accordingly
- Progression generation selects different chord sets based on the flag
- `getBassNoteForInversion()` function calculates correct bass notes for slash chord notation
- Instructions updated to reflect the simplified requirements
- No functionality deleted - complete reversibility maintained
