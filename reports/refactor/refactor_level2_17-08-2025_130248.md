## Conclusion

Level 2 represents the most critical refactoring challenge in the codebase, requiring immediate and comprehensive action. The proposed 4-week intensive refactoring plan will transform this 1,192-line monolith into a maintainable, performant, and educationally effective foundation.

The investment required is substantial but absolutely necessary - the current state actively impedes development and provides a poor user experience. The refactored system will enable rapid feature development, improve educational outcomes, and provide a solid foundation for advanced musical concepts.

**Critical Recommendation:** Begin refactoring immediately with full team focus. The current technical debt is compounding daily and represents an existential threat to the project's long-term viability. The proposed solution addresses both immediate concerns and long-term scalability requirements.
