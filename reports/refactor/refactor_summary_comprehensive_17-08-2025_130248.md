2. **Code Duplication Crisis**
   - 85% overlap between core educational components
   - Shared logic reimplemented rather than extracted
   - Bug fixes require changes in multiple locations
   - Inconsistent behavior across similar features

3. **Mixed Abstraction Levels**
   - Low-level music theory calculations in UI components
   - Business logic intertwined with presentation concerns
   - API routes performing complex algorithmic computations

   - No caching or optimization for repeated operations
   - Complex music theory calculations blocking UI interactions
   - Memory leaks from poor state management patterns

### Secondary Issues

1. **Inconsistent Patterns**
   - Different approaches to similar problems across files
   - Mixed state management patterns
   - Inconsistent error handling and validation
   - Varying approaches to music theory calculations

2. **Hard-coded Dependencies**
   - Magic numbers scattered throughout codebase
   - Hardcoded musical configurations and constants
   - Inflexible level progression and difficulty settings
   - Limited extensibility for new features

3. **Testing Impossibility**
   - Tightly coupled components prevent unit testing
   - Music theory logic cannot be tested in isolation
   - Complex interdependencies make integration testing difficult
   - No validation of music theory accuracy
